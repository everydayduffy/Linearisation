##LINEARISING_TIFFS##

Script and Function used to apply coefficients from a second order polynomial equation to transform the 
data found in R, G and B bands of a GeoTIFF. The code also projects the data to a desired coordinate 
system, and outputs a GeoTIFF with reflectance values in each band (rounded to 2 decimal points).
